It helps in managing the complexities of software development, minimizing risks, and improving the quality and success rate of software projects.
   

2. Project Life Cycle:
   - Describe the stages of the software project life cycle. What activities are typically performed in each stage?
      -Answer
   stages of software development lifecycle include
1)planning-This stage involves creating detailed plans to guide the execution of the project from initiation to closure. It involves defining project objectives, scope, deliverables, timelines, resources, and risks
2)Requirements gathering-This stage focuses on gathering requirements from stakeholders i.e. clients, users,  to understand their needs and expectations of the software. This phase sets the foundation for the entire development process 
3)Design-The software's architecture, user interface (UI), and system components are designed using the requirements gathered. The phase  involves creating blueprints, mockups, and technical specifications that on how the software will function.
4)Development-developers start building the software using programming languages and tools.  This stage involves writing code, integrating different components and dependencies
5)Testing-Once the software is developed, rigorous testing is conducted to identify and fix bugs and errors.  Testers ensure the software functions as intended, meets user requirements, and performs well under various conditions
6)Deployment-After successful testing, the software is deployed to its designated users
7)Maintenance-This stage involves fixing bugs reported by users, adding new features, and updating the software to address security vulnerabilities or keep pace with changing technologies.

3. Project Management Methodologies:
   - Compare and contrast at least two software project management methodologies (e.g., Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban). What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
      Answer
   The Waterfall methodology is a traditional, linear approach to software development where the project is divided into sequential phases, and each phase must be completed before moving on to the next one. 
 The phases in the Waterfall methodology typically include:

Requirements Gathering and Analysis
System Design
Implementation (Coding)
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance

ADVANTAGE
1)Simple and easy to understand: The Waterfall methodology is straightforward and follows a logical sequence, making it easy for project stakeholders to understand and follow.
2)Well-defined phases: Each phase has a clear start and end point, making it easier to plan and manage the project.
3)Clear Documentation: Each phase produces documentation, which serves as a reference point throughout the project lifecycle.
4)Suitable for stable and well-defined projects: If the project requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change significantly, the Waterfall methodology can be effective.

Disadvantages of waterfall methodology
1)Inflexible to change: Once a phase is completed, it is difficult and costly to go back and make changes, making the methodology poorly suited for projects with evolving or changing requirements.
2)Delayed feedback and testing: Testing occurs late in the development cycle, which can lead to costly rework if significant issues are discovered.
3)Unrealistic assumptions: The Waterfall methodology assumes that all requirements can be gathered upfront and that no changes will occur during the development process, which is often an unrealistic assumption in modern software development

Agile software development is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Instead of following a sequential, linear process, Agile relies on short development cycles called sprints or iterations,

ADVANTAGES
1)Flexibility and adaptability: Agile methodologies embrace change and allow for requirements to evolve throughout the development process, making it easier to adapt to changing customer needs or market conditions.
2)Early and continuous delivery: Working software is delivered frequently  throughout the project, allowing stakeholders to provide early feedback and make adjustments as needed.
3)improved Quality: Continuous testing and integration practices help in identifying and fixing defects early, resulting in higher quality software.
4)Improved collaboration and communication: Agile emphasizes close collaboration between cross-functional teams, including developers, testers, and business stakeholders, fostering better communication and understanding.
5)Higher customer satisfaction: By involving customers throughout the development process and delivering working software frequently, Agile methodologies help ensure that the final product meets customer needs and expectations.

DISADVANTAGES
1)Scope Creep: The flexibility to accommodate changes can sometimes lead to scope creep, where the project continues to expand beyond its original objectives
2)Lack of comprehensive documentation: Agile's emphasis on working software over comprehensive documentation can lead to insufficient or incomplete documentation, making maintenance and knowledge transfer more difficult
3)Dependency on Team Collaboration: Agile heavily relies on team collaboration and communication. If team dynamics are poor, it can negatively impact the projectâ€™s success.
